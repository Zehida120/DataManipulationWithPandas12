## About

Data Visualization with Pandas: The dataset contains observations taken from newly born babies in a hospital, i performed summary statistics and grouped summary statistics using pivot table. I also performed custom summary statistics by defining functions using PCT, then calling the numerical column with the agg method. I also used several methods like describe which is used to display summary statistics of numerical columns, groupby method, head method, etc. I also performed slicing on inner and outer level indexes. I performed slicing on the inner level index by passing a list of tuples in the loc function
